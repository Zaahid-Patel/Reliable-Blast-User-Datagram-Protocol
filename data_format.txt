Initial TCP Signal that sends Receiver's port and host address
    Format: Byte array with total 124 bytes.
    First 24 bytes is the portNumber
    Last 100 bytes are the host address

This is only an arbratrary selected amount, subject to change

Code that should be able to read incoming bytes
[combined] is the incoming packet
NOTE does not remove blank bytes
//TESTCODE
    byte[] port = Arrays.copyOfRange(combined, 0, 24);
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(port);
    int intValue = buffer.getInt();
    System.out.println(intValue);
    
    byte[] name = Arrays.copyOfRange(combined, 24, 124);
    String stringValue = new String(name);
    System.out.println(stringValue);
